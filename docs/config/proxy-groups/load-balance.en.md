## Common Fields

Refer to [Common Fields](./index.md).

## Strategy

Load Balancing Strategies

* `round-robin` will distribute all requests among different proxy nodes within the strategy group.

* `consistent-hashing` will assign requests with the same `target address` to the same proxy node within the strategy group.

* `sticky-sessions`: requests with the same `source address` and `target address` will be directed to the same proxy node within the strategy group, with a cache expiration of 10 minutes.

!!! note
    When the `target address` is a domain, it uses top-level domain matching.
