# Predefined Proxy Group

## GLOBAL

Default fill all proxy-groups and proxies

The strategy group can also be customized in the configuration file

However, the web panel and some client applications sort according to the order of policy groups within the GLOBAL policy group

It is recommended to write out all the policy groups of the current configuration in full (except for the GLOBAL itself) when customizing the GLOBAL policy group
