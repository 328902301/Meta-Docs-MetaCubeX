## enable

Whether to enable; if set to false, the system DNS resolution will be used.

## cache-algorithm

supports the following algorithms:

- lru: Least Recently Used, default value
- arc: Adaptive Replacement Cache

## prefer-h3

DOH will prioritize the use of HTTP/3.

## listen

DNS service listening, supports UDP, TCP.

## IPV6

Whether to resolve IPV6; if set to false, it will respond with empty resolutions for AAAA records.

## enhanced-mode

Optional values are `fake-ip`/`redir-host`, default is `redir-host`.

This refers to the DNS processing mode of mihomo.

## fake-ip-range

Settings for the IP range under fakeip; the default IPV4 address for [tun](../inbound/tun.md) also uses this value as a reference.

## fake-ip-filter

Fakeip filtering; the following addresses will not receive fakeip mappings for connections.

Values support [domain wildcards](../../handbook/syntax.md#domain-wildcards) and [importing domain sets](../../handbook/syntax.md#introducing-domain-sets).

## fake-ip-filter-mode: blacklist

Optional values are `blacklist`/`whitelist`, default is `blacklist`. In `whitelist`, only successful matches will return fake-ip.

## use-hosts

Whether to respond to the configured [hosts](./hosts.md); default is true.

## use-system-hosts

Whether to query the system hosts; default is true.

## respect-rules

DNS connections comply with [routing rules](../rules/index.md), requiring configuration of [proxy-server-nameserver](./index.md#proxy-server-nameserver).

!!! note ""
    It is strongly not recommended to use it with `prefer-h3`.

## default-nameserver

Default DNS, used for resolving the domain names of DNS servers.

!!! note ""
    Must be an IP, can be encrypted DNS.

## nameserver-policy

Specifies the resolving servers for domain queries, can use geosite, prioritized over `nameserver/fallback queries`.

Keys support [domain wildcards](../../handbook/syntax.md#domain-wildcards).

Values support strings/arrays.

## proxy-server-nameserver

The proxy node domain resolution server is used solely for resolving the domain names of proxy nodes. If left blank, it will follow the configurations of nameserver-policy, nameserver, and fallback.

## direct-nameserver

The DNS server for domain resolution at the direct exit. If left blank, it will follow the configurations of nameserver-policy, nameserver, and fallback.

## direct-nameserver-follow-policy

Indicates whether to adhere to the nameserver-policy. The default is not to comply, and it only takes effect when direct-nameserver is not empty.

## nameserver

Default domain name resolution server.

## fallback

Backup domain name resolution servers, generally using overseas DNS to ensure reliable results.

After configuring `fallback`, `fallback-filter` is enabled by default, with `geoip-code` set to CN.

## fallback-filter

Filtering for backup domain name resolution servers; those meeting the conditions will use `fallback` results or only use `fallback` for resolution.

### geoip

Whether to enable geoip judgment.

### geoip-code

Optional values are country abbreviations, default value is `CN`.

Results from IPs other than those configured with `geoip-code` will be considered polluted.

Results from the country configured with `geoip-code` will be adopted directly; otherwise, `fallback` results will be used.

### geosite

Optional values are collections included in the corresponding geosite.

Contents of the geosite list are considered polluted; domain names matching the geosite will only use `fallback` resolution, not `nameserver`.

### ipcidr

Written as `IP/mask`.

Results from these subnets will be considered polluted; when `nameserver` resolves these results, it will adopt `fallback` resolution results.

### domain

These domains are considered polluted; matching these domains will directly use `fallback` resolution, not `nameserver`.

## Additional Parameters

This section can be used for DNS servers directed to public network addresses, using `#` for addition and `&` to connect different parameters.

Except for specifying the proxy/interface and ecs, the values of the remaining items are all bool (true/false).

### Example

```{.yaml linenums="1"}
dns:
  nameserver:
  - 'https://8.8.8.8/dns-query#proxy&ecs=1.1.1.1/24&ecs-override=true'
proxies:
- name: proxy
  type: ss
```

### DNS specifies proxy/interface for connection

Prefer using existing proxies; if a proxy with that name does not exist, specify the interface for connection.

`#RULES` is to connect in accordance with routing rules, equivalent to [respect-rules](./index.md#respect-rules).

If querying through a proxy is required, `proxy-server-nameserver` should be configured to prevent egg issues.

### h3

Force HTTP/3

This option does not conflict with `prefer-h3`. After filling it in, it forces the use of HTTP/3 to establish a DOH connection. Please ensure that the DOH server supports HTTP/3 before using it.

### skip-cert-verify

Skip TLS certificate verification

### ecs

Specify the subnet address for DNS queries

### ecs-override

Forcefully override the subnet address of DNS queries

### disable-ipv4

Discard A responses

### disable-ipv6

Discard AAAA response
