## tls

Enables TLS, applicable only to protocols that use `tls`, with the `trojan` protocol requiring it to be enabled.

## sni/servername

The server name indication, referred to as `servername` in [`VMess`](./vmess.md)/[`VLESS`](./vless.md). If left empty, it defaults to the address in `server`.

## fingerprint

Certificate fingerprint, applicable only to protocols that use `tls`.

## alpn

List of supported Application Layer Protocol Negotiation options, arranged in order of priority.

If both peers support ALPN, the selected protocol will be one from this list; if there are no mutually supported protocols, the connection will fail.

Refer to [Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation)

## skip-cert-verify

Bypasses certificate verification, applicable only to protocols that use `tls`.

## certificate

If filled, this enables [mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) (must be filled in with private-key). The content is the certificate in PEM format or the path to the certificate.

## private-key

If filled, this enables [mTLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/) (must be filled in with certificate). The content is the private key corresponding to the certificate in PEM format or the path to the private key.

## client-fingerprint

Client uTLS fingerprint, applicable only to [`VMess`](./vmess.md)/[`VLESS`](./vless.md)/[`Trojan`](./trojan.md) protocols. For optional details, refer to [Global Client Fingerprint](../general.md#global-client-fingerprint).

## reality-opts

Configuration for reality; if not empty, reality will be enabled.

### reality-opts.public-key

Public key corresponding to the reality server's private key.

### reality-opts.short-id

One of the server's short IDs.

### reality-opts.support-x25519mlkem768

Support for X25519-MLKEM768 key exchange.

## ech-opts

### ech-opts.enable

Enables ECH (Encrypted Client Hello). If not empty, ECH will be enabled.

### ech-opts.config

Base64-encoded configuration for ECH.
